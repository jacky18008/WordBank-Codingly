# WordBank-Codingly 

Workbank is such an importmant tool while taking tests like Toefl and GRE,
however, writing a tidy wordbank by hand is so difficult for some people like me. 

Though managing our wordbank in json files sounds a good idea, 
but update every word like: "wordbank["You"]["Care about money"] = {}" also sounds stupid,
so I write a simple script to make it easier.

You can use jupyter notebook to mutually make your own wordbank by the .ipynb file, 
and for the people who is too geek to use IDE, you can also run the python version,
but for there is only some function definition, write some other scripts by your own. 

For the simplicity(laziness) reason, there are some default assumptions in it,
feel free to customize it!
